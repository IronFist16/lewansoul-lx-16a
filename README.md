# Why

The download on LewanSoul's website to configure my new servos doesn't play well with Linux.  In fact, can't load it through wine at all.  Not finding a linux version in my searches, and I'll need to write most of what this program will do into my REAL project anyway, so why not build a PYQT5 version to share?
